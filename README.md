## About
"Unscheinbar" is a randomly generated experimental psychological horror "game".
It's kind of a "playground" for both learning JavaScript and WebGL as well as testing out some weired game mechanics that wouldn't fit a normal game.

See the designDocument.dot in the drafts directory for more details and an assorted list of ideas.

## Note
Since this is some kind of playground for testing out my twisted ideas it's a living work in progress and won't usually be playable at all ;)

## Required libraries
The following external JS libraries are required for this project
- AngularJS - https://angularjs.org/
- glMatrix - http://glmatrix.net/
